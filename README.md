# Simple Guide to Serving a Language Model Locally

## Overview
This guide explains how to set up and serve a language model, such as GPT-2, using Hugging Face's Transformers library on a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) VM.

## Steps
###  Install Dependencies:

Update your VM and install Python and pip.
Install the Transformers library and PyTorch.
### Deploy the Language Model:

Choose and set up GPT-2, a popular language model from Hugging Face.
Test your installation and the model to ensure it's working correctly.
### Serve the Model:

Install Flask, a web framework.
Create a simple web server using Flask to provide an API endpoint for your model.
This server will accept requests with a text prompt and return a generated response from the model.
### Run and Test the Server:

Start your Flask application.
Your API will be accessible via your VM's external IP.
Test the API using tools like curl or Postman by sending a POST request and observing the response.
